These closely match real assets, except that the jp2 files have been
replaced with small text files:

* `S2A_OPER_PRD_MSIL1C_PDMC_20161030T191653_R079_V20161030T095132_20161030T095132.zip`

This file is junk, but it's named accurately for a chirps process test:

* `africa-daily-chirps-v2.0.1997.07.01.tif.gz`

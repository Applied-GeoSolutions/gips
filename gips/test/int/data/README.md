This file closely matches a real asset, except that the jp2 files have been
replaced with small text files:

`S2A_OPER_PRD_MSIL1C_PDMC_20160119T230435_R011_V20160119T155447_20160119T155447.zip`

This file is junk, but it's named accurately for a chirps process test:

`africa-daily-chirps-v2.0.1997.07.01.tif.gz`

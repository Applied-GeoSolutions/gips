# GIPS

See http://gipit.github.io/gips/ for documentation, but know it is not
necessarily current.

## Installation

After cloning this git repo & changing to its directory, run `install.sh`,
which only supports recent versions of Ubuntu.  It will use `sudo` to install
system packages, and may ask for authentication accordingly.  It runs apt-get,
which may prompt you for confirmation of its actions.
